# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

USING Git with this project - Recurring Workflow
Branch
You make separate branches for each feature so that you don’t push up half incomplete code on the main branch
when you need to go work on something else and you’re the feature is not completed. You push up the branch
after you’re done.

1. Make a branch
git checkout -b feature_name
*Make sure no one is working in the MAIN branch!*
Do your work
2. git add -A and git / commit -m 'message'
3. git fetch
4. git rebase

AS UPSTREAM:
- git fetch origin
- git rebase origin/main 
- npm install (if new package added)
- git push origin <branchName>
